# Short Introduction
Hi! My name is Robert and I am currently a PhD Student at the AiLab of the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg. 
My research is orbiting around the field of neurosicence, geometry, music and uncertainty. 
I am still in an explorative phase so hit me up for more information. I am happy for suggestions, chats or discussions!

# Reseach interests
- Music: Here I am specially interested in how to enhance creative workflows with articial intelligence
- Neuroscience:  I just like it, but I want to include it with a focus on music into my PhD
- Uncertainty: my current project involves a decent amount of uncertainty estimation, stay tuned for more information coming soon
- Geomtry: is just awesome! This and music will be the main pillars of my PhD thesis!
