# Short Introduction
Hi! My name is Robert and I am a Ph.D. student at the AiLab of the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg. 
My research is orbiting around neuroscience, geometry, music and uncertainty. 
I am still in an explorative phase so hit me up for more information. I am happy for suggestions, chats or discussions!

Besides that, I am a father of two and a truly lucky husband, since my wife is just awesome. 

# Reseach interests

I love electronic music. Especially 90s and contemporary techno with its more fast-paced style. However, I love music in general and if I find time between my Ph.D. and family, I try to produce music on my own. Luckily, my PhD advisor loves music too and thus I have seldom opportunity to combine my Ph.D. thesis with my passion. I am especially interested in 
- how to enhance creative workflows with artificial intelligence (AI),
- how to include neuroscience with the help of AI into this music,
- how to make decisions based on uncertainty and surprise and
- and how sound may be connected to geometric structures and how manipulation of one of these will affect the other.
